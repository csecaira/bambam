This project is a final project for an Open Software Class. The original project in which this is forked from is Bambam,
which is a game that allows for children to freely draw and keyboard smash without causing damage to keyboard. Key changes
were three minigames: matching game, read aloud, and tracing. The project mainly uses Python. 

To use: 
Must have: Python ( versions 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11 are supported), Pygame (version 2.x preferable), PyYAML (mainly for extension use)
Download the bambam-1.4.0.zip or bambam-1.4.0.tar.gz file.
Unzip bambam-1.4.0.zip or tar zxvf bambam-1.4.0.tar.gz to create the bambam-1.4.0 directory.
Change into the bambam-1.4.0 directory
Run the program using: python bambam.py
