This project is a final project for an Open Software Class. The original project in which this is forked from is Bambam,
which is a game that allows for children to freely draw and keyboard smash without causing damage to keyboard. Key changes
were three minigames: matching game, read aloud, and tracing. The project mainly uses Python.
